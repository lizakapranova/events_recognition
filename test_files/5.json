This includes factors such as the number and value of completed Tasks, Disputes, Mutual Cancellations, and other relevant indicators. Following this calculation, all participants are ranked in descending order based on their ratings, ranging from the highest level 5 to level 0.\n\tThe level scale serves to illustrate the percentage of Freelancers you surpass in the overall ranking. For instance, if you consider a list of 100 Freelancers and your current score stands at 45%, it signifies that you outrank 45 out of the 100 Freelancers in terms of rating. Consequently, you hold the 55th position on this list.\n\tTo ensure real-time accuracy, the Freelancer's rating undergoes recalculation on a daily basis, keeping the information consistently up to date.\n\tCheck out our article on maintaining a stellar reputation to enhance your rating through effective communication with buyers.\nRead the article\nUsers' Reviews\nAmanda Dixon\nEconomist, business consultant\nI do not consider myself a creative person.
